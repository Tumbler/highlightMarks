# Highlight Marks
A vim plugin that highlights marks with different colors so you know where they are.

There is also a command to get rid of the highlighting if starts annoying you: `:RemoveMarkHighlights`. With no arguments it will clear all mark highlighting. If you give a list of characters, it will clear the highlighting for the specified marks only.
